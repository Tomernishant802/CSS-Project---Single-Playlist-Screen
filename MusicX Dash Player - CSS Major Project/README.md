# CodingNinja-CSS Major Project(Single Playlist Music Player)
I am Nishant Tomer and I am Student of Coading Ninjas Full Stack Web Development Course(JULY Batch).This is the Major Project of the front end development in which we have to make Homepage and single playlist page for a Online Music PLayer website like Gaana,Spotify,etc. but only Using only HTML and CSS (can use JS in it later to make it more resposive and attractive).


Main Homepage of this website is index.html and styling for the html is done by external css called stylesheet.css and for the Playlist page html is Single Playlist Screen.html and styling css is Single Playlist Screen Style.css and there are two more css files those for to make the pages more responsive and I don't think that you need to touch those and all the media(images) required for these pages are in media folder and I also have given the zip file of it by the name "media.zip".
